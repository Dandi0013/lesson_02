        <p>Known for his range of passing, crossing ability and bending free-kicks as a right winger, Beckham has been hailed as one of the greatest and most recognisable midfielders of his generation, as well as one of the best set-piece specialists of all time.[15][16] He was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or in 1999, twice runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year (1999 and 2001) and in 2004 was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[17][18][19] He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2008 and the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021.[20] A global ambassador of the sport, Beckham is considered to be a British cultural icon.</p>

        <h3><center>Early life and family</center></h3>
            <p>
            Beckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England.[27] He is the son of Sandra Georgina (née West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan "Ted" Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, 1948), a kitchen fitter, who married in the London Borough of Hackney in 1969.[28] He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He attended Chingford County High School in Ridgeway Park, Chingford.[29] In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, "At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do."[30] Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish,[31] and Beckham has referred to himself as "half Jewish"[32] and wrote in his autobiography "I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion".[33] In his book Both Feet on the Ground, Beckham stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.

        <h3><center>Club career</center></h3>
            <p>
            Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,[40] Beckham was part of a group of young players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who were coached by Eric Harrison, and helped the club win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3–1 first-leg win of the final against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3–2 in favour of Manchester United and 6–3 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.

            <p>
            Beckham's relationship and marriage to Victoria, who has been famous in her own right as part of the Spice Girls, contributed to his celebrity beyond football.
            Beckham became known as a fashion icon, and together with Victoria, the couple became lucrative spokespeople sought after by clothing designers, health and fitness specialists, fashion magazines, and perfume and cosmetics manufacturers. Early endorsements included the British hair styling brand Brylcreem for £4 million in 1997 which saw him appear in UK commercials.[296] In 2002 he was hailed as the ultimate "metrosexual" by the man who invented the term[297] and has been described as such by numerous other articles since.[298] While heterosexual, Beckham actively courted a gay fanbase and openly supported gay media, preferring to give interviews to publications that supported the LGBTQ community. He came to be called a "gay icon" – a term he embraces – for his popularity and support among the gay community.[299] The various iconic hairstyles he sported throughout his career – including a buzz cut, a Mowhawk, and a ponytail – were widely covered in the media.
